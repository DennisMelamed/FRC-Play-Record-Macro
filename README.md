# FRC-Play-Record-Macro
These three classes allow FRC teams to record an autonomous program in Teleop Mode, then replay it in Auto.

Team 2220 used this in our 2015 season for Recycle Rush

Implement the stuff in BTMain in your Main class (or the equivalent)

Then have both the other classes in there too.
